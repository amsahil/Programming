Help Ishaan

P.S:- Ishaan has been given a task by his teacher. He needs to find the Nth term of a series.
    His teacher gives him some examples to help him out (Refer examples below).
    He is a bit weak in pattern searching so to help him his teacher told him that the Nth term is related to prime numbers.
    The Nth term is the difference of N and the closest prime number to N. Help him find the Nth term for a given N.


Example 1:
Input: N = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: Closest prime to 10 is 11.

Example 2:
Input: N = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: Closest prime to 7 is 7.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100000

Expected Time Complexity: O(N* âˆš N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
